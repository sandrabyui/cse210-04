# CYCLE

Go head to head in this exciting new game. Outlast your opponent as you leave uncrossible bike trails. Box them in, evade their traps, outlive and outlast! 

## Getting Started

---

Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 4.0.0.5 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.

```
Windows: python3 -m pip install raylib

Mac: python3 -m pip install -U raylib --user
```

After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.```

python3 cycle

```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the
project folder. Select the main module inside the greed folder and click the "run" icon.
